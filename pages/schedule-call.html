    <!-- Use the base stylesheet for all your CSS, ensuring consistency by only using the predefined colors—do not introduce new colors. Reusable components, such as buttons, text areas, input fields, and checkboxes, are available in the components folder. Simply copy and paste them as needed.

    Prioritize accessibility in your design, but for now, focus on building the components. DO NOT MODIFY THE INDEX.HTML, and do not code the footer or navigation. Ensure the layout is responsive.
